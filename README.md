simpleprojects
==============

A collection of fun projects I did with my free time.

The simpletimer html file can be opened with any modern browser.

The calculator python file runs on the command line with "python calculator.py"
and takes any infix notation that works on a TI-84 calculator, converts it to
prefix notation and analyzes it.
